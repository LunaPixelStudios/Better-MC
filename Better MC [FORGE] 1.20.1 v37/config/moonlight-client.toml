	#Fix minecraft entity shading to be exactly the same that blocks use. (1 for up,0.8 for north, 0.6 for west and 0.5 for down).This means that if you have a model and render it with a tile renderer or entity it will appear identical as one rendered via baked models.Using no gui will prevent it from changing item rendered in GUIs, in case you dont like that look.Note there is a known compat issue with Figura mod. Keep this True or False with that one
