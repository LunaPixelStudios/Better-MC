  "comment1": "These filters and adjustments affect all watut animations in the same way",
  "comment2": "filters support @ for mod id, and * at the start or end of the match for partial matches",
  "comment3": "in adjustments section, you can specify 'DISABLED' to outright disable any animation on that hand and axis, or use degrees to adjust by a certain amount",
  "comment4": "matchingHandX and matchingHandY are probably all you need, for watuts animations, X is the main up/down, and Y is left/right, Z is available but usually not needed",
  "comment5": "matchingHand is for adjusting the hand that actually has the item, otherHand is for adjusting the other hand if matchingHand matched something",
  "comment6": "using otherHand along with matchingHand is useful for disabling or adjusting movement when using items that change both hands, like gun mods or 2 handed weapons",
  "comment7": "you can make a rule only active if a specfic mod is installed by using 'only_if_mod_installed' with a mod id, see its use below for an example",
  "comment8": "matching priority order is first to last, so in this file, highest to lowest, higher overrides lower if both match",
  "comment9": "use '/watut reloadJSON' (forge builds only) to reload this config in game to see your changes instantly",
