This directory is for a few additional options for YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses.
Options provided may vary by version.
This directory contains subdirectories for supported versions. The first time you run Better Nether Fortresses, a version subdirectory will be created if that version supports advanced options.
For example, the first time you use Better Nether Fortresses for MC 1.21 on Forge, the 'forge-1_21' subdirectory will be created in this folder.
If no subdirectory for your version is created, then that version probably does not support the additional options.
NOTE -- Most of this mod's config settings can be found in a config file outside this folder!
For example, on Forge 1.21 the file is 'betterfortresses-forge-1_21.toml'.
Also note that many of the structure's settings such as spawn rate & spawn conditions can only be modified via data pack.
