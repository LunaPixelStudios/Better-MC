This directory is for a few additional options for YUNG's Better Strongholds.
Options provided may vary by version.
This directory contains subdirectories for supported versions. The first time you run Better Strongholds, a version subdirectory will be created if that version supports advanced options.
For example, the first time you use Better Strongholds for MC 1.21 on Fabric, the 'fabric-1_21' subdirectory will be created in this folder.
If no subdirectory for your version is created, then that version probably does not support the additional options.
NOTE -- SOME OPTIONS CAN BE FOUND IN A CONFIG FILE OUTSIDE THIS FOLDER!
For example, on Fabric 1.21 the file is 'betterstrongholds-fabric-1_21.toml'.
