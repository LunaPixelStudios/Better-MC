# Enables support for servers with multiple identically-named worlds.

# When enabled, a new local cache is started on each world change. If there are enough chunks with similar content in two caches, they will automatically be merged.
# This does mean that you may need to walk around a little before Bobby loads in cached chunks if there is little identifying information in your world (e.g. flat worlds).
# 
# You may need to delete your existing cache if it is comprised of multiple worlds to prevent Bobby from merging into it.
# Requires a `/bobby upgrade` after enabling with existing cache.
