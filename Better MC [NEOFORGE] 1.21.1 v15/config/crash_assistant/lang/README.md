Hi Localizer!

## Contributing

If you want to add new language to the mod, please create a pull request with a new or modified file:
https://github.com/KostromDan/Crash-Assistant/

lang files locate here in source code:`common_config/src/main/resources/lang`

## Changing text for the modpack

If you want to change some text, don't edit the jar directly. Instead, you can modify the files in config/crash_assistant/lang.

You can also add an entirely new language file in this directory, and it will work.

"$DEFAULT" value means value will be taken from jar lang(if exists), else from en_us.

Warning: don't try to use any utils of changing lang like KubeJs, resourcepacks, etc. It won't work.
